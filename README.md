# Semantic Searcher

This project consists of a search engine specialized in carrying out semantic searches in scientific texts which contain biomedical concepts and clinical sentences. To achieve this, I have implemented a Streamlit application which uses sentence similarity models to do the vector embeddings and ChromaDB to store this vectors. The main objective of the project is to offer an alternative to traditional search engines, wich only look for keyword matches and do not take into account the overall meaning of the query.
